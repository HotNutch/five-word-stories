It was a blistering hot summer day when Rick unfortunately had turned himself into a pickle. Morty and Summer, thinking that the old man had finally lost his marbles decided to call in the President. The POTUS was extremely vexed that nobody had thought to shut down the portal gun pointing to the otherworldly dimension. The aliens were aiming to take Rick and turn him into the All Supreme Leader of Cynics.
